Candy Crush Game (Clone)

This is a simple Candy Crush-style game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I created this project by following a [YouTube tutorial]((https://youtu.be/8yIKZQMGi0A)) by [Kenny Yip]. It was a great way to strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event listeners, and basic game logic.

##  What I Learned
- Improved my JavaScript skills by working with logic for swapping and matching game pieces
- Learned how to update the layout dynamically as the game changes
- Gained confidence in breaking down problems and applying logic step by step
- Practiced using HTML and CSS to structure and style a fully functional mini-game

##  How to Play
Just open the `index.html` file in a browser and enjoy matching the candies!

- Score tracking for various users
- Leaderboard
- Sound effects
